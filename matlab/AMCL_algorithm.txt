Inputs: List of old particles, control, sensor_measurements, map
Also need: running exponential averages (w_slow, w_fast), constants (a_slow, a_fast)

initialize lists of candidate_particles, output_particles to empty lists

w_avg = 0

for each particle in the input list:
  move it forward with the given motion model
  assign it a likelihood based on how well it matches sensor data
  add {particle, likelihood} pair to candidate_particles
  w_avg += 1/(# of particles) * likelihood of particle
  
calculate w_slow, w_fast

for each particle in the candidate list:
  if probability[ max(0,1-w_fast/w_slow) ]:
    add random pose to output_particles
  else:
    pick a particle in candidate_particles with weight proportional to its likelihood

return output_particles
