 Path

 This is a class that generates high level goals in the map frame
 for a robot to achieve. It is designed to sync with a 
 Leader node that takes the published goals, and then generates
 Odometry targets between them for the robot to follow (think carrot
 on a stick).

 Interface:
 srv/path/goal - returns current goal
 srv/path/next - moves path to next goal, returns that goal
 srv/path/start - returns starting goal
 srv/path/back - moves path to previous goal, returns that goal
 msg/path/current - publishes current goal
